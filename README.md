Webbased Home Automation Management System

While unweary, the name should tell you all you need to know. WHAMS is a home automation system, allowing for easy integration of devices into nodenetworks, allowing for decentralized management of your home! It's hard to press so much into so few words, but if you want a summary, that's the best I can give.

There are many alternatives for this kind of application, some better, some worse. This isn't meant to be some for-profit thing, rather a project where people can come together and build something amazing. So, you are more than welcome to go over my shitty code, come with new ideas, and generally test WHAMS.
